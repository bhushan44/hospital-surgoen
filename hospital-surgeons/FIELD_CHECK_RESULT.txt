## Field Availability Check

**RESULT: ✅ YES - All Required Fields Exist!**

The database has all fields we need, just with different names or in different tables:

1. **Hospitals**: ✅ All core fields (phone→contact_phone, website→website_url)
2. **Doctors**: ✅ All fields (consultationFee in assignments table)
3. **Bookings**: ✅ Use 'assignments' table (better structure)
4. **Payments**: ✅ Use 'paymentTransactions' + 'assignmentPayments'
5. **Reviews**: ✅ Use 'assignmentRatings' (better structure)
6. **Specialties**: ✅ Core fields available
7. **Notifications**: ✅ More flexible structure
8. **Subscriptions**: ✅ Complete with payment tracking

**Key Insight**: Database structure is BETTER than our design - more comprehensive!

**Action**: Just need to map field names and use correct tables.
