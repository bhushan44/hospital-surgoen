## API Test Summary

**Status**: Tests executed but database connection issues prevent full testing

**Key Findings**:
1. ✅ Server is running and responding
2. ✅ API endpoints are accessible
3. ✅ Swagger documentation is working
4. ❌ Database connection is failing
5. ❌ Most tests skipped due to missing auth tokens (because signup fails)

**APIs Tested**: 41 endpoints
**Passed**: 0
**Failed**: 6 (database errors)
**Skipped**: 35 (due to missing dependencies from failed tests)

**Next Steps**:
1. Fix database connection (check DATABASE_URL in .env.local)
2. Run migrations: npm run db:push
3. Re-run tests: npm run test:api
